   - how long do we need to compute a single model before it
     becomes stationary ?
     (( Compare init=0 to init=1 models! ))
     (( Same answer as from diffuse atmos1.in? ))
   - do the results converge for increasing number of grid points?
   - how far up/down do we need to expand the model until the results
     converge? 

1) how does old static_weather compare to weather?
   - cloud thickness
   - cloud material composition
   - gas element abundances

2) influence of Teff ?

3) influence of logg ?

4) influence of beta ?

5) are there permanent weather cycles ?

6) do we get secondary cloud layers (Na2S, KCl) ?

7) other important dust kinds ?

9) how important is dust diffusion ?
   - upward diffusion of seed particles ?

10) how important is evap_model ?

11) can we make a model for the Earth atmosphere ?
